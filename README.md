# Soilphia

soilphia (Soil-phi-a) aims to be a computational solution to solve [Richard equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_equation). Meanwhile, it should be designed for interaction with agricultural decision making (can be interrupted then giving dynamic input) such as irrigation management(control).

## Purpose
We want to develop  dynamic irrigation strategy (control method) in simulation environment. But most of hydraulic simulation softwares can not support dynamic changing irrigation input in run-time.
